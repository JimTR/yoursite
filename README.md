Beta CMS 
<h3><u>This software uses a modified version of simple php frame work for some of its classes </u></h3>
The idea behind this software is to produce a cms/forum  that is easy for the end administrator to administer.
use a html editor (drag & drop or otherwise) to edit the non dynamic content (templates)
dynamic content will be supplied by a very simple php structure, obbtained by very simple classes and functions.
Let's keep it simple !
