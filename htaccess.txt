# This turns on mod_rewrite and redirects any paths that don't physically exist
# to /index.php. You can then access that path info (to determine what to do) in
# PHP using $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] and $_SERVER['REDIRECT_URL']. This is an easy
# way to avoid having hundreds of rewrite rules slowing down Apache and making things
# more complicated than they should be.
#don't forget to un comment !
# Note: If you're having trouble making Apache pickup your .htaccess file,
# make sure AllowOverride is set to "All" instead of "None".
